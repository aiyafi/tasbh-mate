  <h3>A digital tasbih (prayer counter) application built with React</h3>
</div>

## üìù Description

TasbhMate is envisioned as a modern digital tasbih application designed to help Muslims keep track of their dhikr (remembrance of Allah) as an online service. The initial goal is to allow users to store their prayer counts and continue them seamlessly across different devices by leveraging Convex for backend data storage and NextAuth for authentication.

Currently, due to ongoing development and skill limitations, TasbhMate utilizes **local storage** to persist the count within the same browser. However, the long-term vision remains to provide a fully online experience with cross-device synchronization.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components for a clean and intuitive interface.
- **Simple Counter Interface**: Large, easy-to-read numbers with smooth animations.
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Click/tap the screen, use keyboard shortcuts, or buttons.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Space` - Increment count
  - `-` - Decrement count
- **Current Persistence (Local Storage)**: Your count is currently saved automatically within your browser's local storage between sessions.
- **Future Persistence (Online Synchronization)**: The goal is to enable automatic saving and synchronization of your count across all your devices once the online service with Convex is implemented.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Choose your preferred theme.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices from mobile to desktop.
- **Particle Effects**: Beautiful interactive background particles.
- **Authentication (Planned)**: User accounts via NextAuth (Google, GitHub, and credentials) will be implemented to link your count to your account for cross-device access.
- **Prayer Tracking and History (Future)**: Plan to implement a feature to track and view your prayer history.
